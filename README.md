## Description
This is a simple web-based Political Compass Quiz that helps users visualize their political leanings on a two-dimensional graph. The quiz covers economic (left/right) and social (authoritarian/libertarian) perspectives through a series of questions.

## Features
- 20 weighted questions covering different political viewpoints
- Interactive user interface with Yes/No buttons
- Real-time score calculation
- Visual representation of results using a political compass chart
- Breakdown of individual scores for each category (Left, Right, Liberal, Non-Liberal)

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Chart.js (for visualization)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Answer each question by clicking either "Yes" or "No".
4. After answering all questions, view your results on the political compass chart.

## File Structure
- `political_compass_quiz.html`: Contains all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the quiz.

## Dependencies
- Chart.js (loaded via CDN)

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the HTML file in a modern web browser.

## How It Works
1. Users answer a series of yes/no questions on various political topics.
2. Each question has an assigned priority (weight).
3. The script calculates scores for left, right, liberal, and non-liberal categories.
4. These scores are used to determine the user's position on the political compass.
5. The resulting graph shows the user's position in one of four quadrants:
   - Authoritarian Left
   - Authoritarian Right
   - Libertarian Left
   - Libertarian Right

## Customization
You can easily customize the quiz by modifying the `questions` object in the JavaScript section of the HTML file. Add, remove, or modify questions and their weights as needed.
